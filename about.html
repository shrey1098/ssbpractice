        <p class="lead">This is a website for practicing SSB psycological tests. It contains WAT and SRT tests.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>The psychological tests are administered on the second day of the five day testing schedule that takes place at the SSB. These tests are based on very scientific procedures of assessing the qualities of a candidate, at his/her subconscious level and the non-conscious state of mind.

            The primary aim of these tests is to assess the potential of a candidate in terms of qualities or personality traits that are desired in a ‘potential officer material’.</p>
            
            <p>The tests are required to be written against the constraint of time. Hence, the candidate is unable to hide his true feelings and the psychologist is able to read the actual personality of the candidate while he/she gives his/her responses in terms of thoughts, feelings and actions.
            
            The four psychological tests that all candidates are put through during their SSB are as follows:</p>
            
            <p>1. Thematic Apperception Test (TAT).</p>
            
            <p>2. Word Association Test (WAT).</p>

            <p>3. Situation Reaction Test (SRT).</p>

            <p>4. Self Description (SD).</p>
            
            
            
            <p>These tests are administered by a psychologist and the results are used to assess the candidate’s personality and his/her potential to become an officer.</p>
            <p>SSB Practice helps you Practice for Word association test and situtation reaction test by displaying the words and situtaion in the stipulated time as given in the SSB.</p>
